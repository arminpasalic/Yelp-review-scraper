# Yelp Review Scraper

This repository contains a simple Python script designed to scrape user reviews (comments, their rating, location) for a specified restaurant from Yelp. The tool is tailored to extract comprehensive feedback, ensuring a thorough understanding of customer experiences.

## Important Notice:
Yelp's website is subject to periodic updates, which may alter its link structures and layout. While efforts will be made to keep this script in sync with such changes, users are encouraged to remain vigilant. Specifically, pay attention to modifications in URL patterns, such as the transition of parameters from "&start=" to "?start=" or vice versa. These shifts are critical as they impact the script's ability to paginate and retrieve subsequent batches of 10 reviews.

## Contributions and Feedback:
Your insights and improvements are invaluable to the evolution of this tool. Should you have any suggestions, encounter issues, or wish to contribute to the project, please feel free to reach out via email at apasalic@protonmail.com.
