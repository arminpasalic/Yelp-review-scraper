# simple_yelp_review_scraper
 A simple scraper for collecting reviews from users on YELP. Designate a specific restaurant and collect all its comments!
 
 Remember - YELP changes sometimes the links and its structure. I will try and keep the script updated, but try and watch yourself and check it out.
Sometimes, simple urls like "&start=" for comments change to "?start=" or reverse. This was the simplest method to go to next page for the next 10 comments. 

Any ideas? You can email me at: apasalic@protonmail.com
